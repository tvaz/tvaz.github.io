If there's a cookbook out there worth me gushing over here, it's [Leanne Brown's *Good and Cheap*](https://www.leannebrown.com/). It's a cookbook that prioritizes accessibility, variety and frugality in a way that a lot of cookbooks just can't measure up to. A lot of "healthy college cookbooks" have cheap recipes, yes- but honestly, as someone who invested in several during her college years, none were very useful. Often the recipes were so simple it barely merited a page (fried egg on ramen, anybody?) and other recipes didn't even work, especially baked goods. I imagine that these were barely tested. They didn't inspire or challenge me in the way I am looking for. I hope those books served somebody well, but I wanted more.

Recipes in *Good and Cheap* are infinitely riffable, a quality I deeply appreciate. When you get comfortable in the kitchen, you often read recipes more like outlines than specific directions; Brown offers creative substitutions and additions for every recipe, setting out to equip her readers with a variety of tools and techniques rather than offering rigid instructions to live by. And if you find that approach intimidating, the recipes themselves are written in clear language that avoids making assumptions about the cook's experience, prioritizing accessibility and clarity for all skill levels. It's a delicate balance, and I really admire the efforts made in this book.

Many recipes are available on her website, including my new favorite go-to weeknight dinner [Chana Masala](https://www.leannebrown.com/chana-masala/). Easily thrown together with a can of tomatoes and some cooked chickpeas, it goes amazing with the raita yogurt sauce and handmade roti flatbreads that are also provided in the book. Spicy, warm, filling and- if you prep the chickpeas ahead of time or used canned- done in less than 30 minutes. That's good enough for me!

Has anyone else tried recipes from this book? It's quickly becoming my bible for meal planning.
