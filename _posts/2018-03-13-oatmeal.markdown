About a month ago, I started a new job that requires me to make a nontrivial commute. I love it, but it can be hard to get going in the morning to make breakfast when I have a long drive every day. So, easy breakfast solutions became necessary.  

I love this breakfast because I can prepare it in advance and stash it in my purse or cupholder on my way to work.  

*Oatmeal in a Jar*  
1/3 cup instant oatmeal  
1 tsp chia seeds  
1 tbs flaxseed meal  
1 tbs brown sugar  
1 tbs nuts (I use sliced almonds)  
1 tbs dried fruit (I use sweetened dried cranberries)  

Combine in a 2-cup mason jar and top off with hot water when ready to eat.  


Try putting a can cozy around the jar if you want to keep it warm longer. Go ahead and play with the ingredient ratios to your taste! You can also add a little almond milk if you would like it to be creamier. Another really fruit/nut combo is chopped walnuts and dried apple pieces or bananas (I unfortunately have a banana allergy, but they pair excellently with oats, dried or fresh. If I could eat them they would definitely be a go-to.  :'(

What are your favorite easy breakfast tricks? :sparkle:
