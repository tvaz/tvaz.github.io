I have gotten my panels approved for [Kumori-con 2019](https://www.kumoricon.org/)!
I do not have specific schedule information yet, but when the final schedule is posted I will update this site accordingly.
I no longer live in the Seattle area, so I am very excited to do my panels for the Portland community! I will likely be attending Sakura-con as well next year in 2020, but nothing concrete yet.
