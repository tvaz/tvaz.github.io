TORI VAZ

Welcome to my site.

My goal was to host some of my independent projects and showcase some of my work. Hopefully I will be able to add more interesting information to this site as it evolves.

I love creative pursuits like crochet, tailoring, illustration, cooking, and origami. I studied Japanese culture in university and have a special passion for Japanese culture and translation. I also am a skilled web programmer who is currently working on some interesting projects, so stay tuned for information on those!

To get into contact with me, shoot me an email at [torivaz@protonmail.com](mailto:torivaz@protonmail.com).
