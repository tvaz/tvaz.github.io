I'm Tori! This is my personal blog/little slice of the web for me to dump miscellaneous thoughts.

I love programming, writing, cooking and coming up with recipes, and research Japanese pop culture. I hope to get into a technical field such as web development (I'm currently working on some projects!), game development, or maybe QE!

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to email me at contact@torivaz.com or victoriavaz24@gmail.com.
