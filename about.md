Hello! My name is Tori Vaz. I am a programmer and artist. I love cooking and video games. Thanks for visiting my site.

I'm passionate about internet freedom, libraries, and free & open-source software. I love to talk about video games (especially Legend of Zelda!) and you can check out my [podcast](podcasts) or come see me at one of my convention [panels](panels) if you like to hear about that kind of thing.

To get into contact with me, shoot me an email at [torivaz@protonmail.com](mailto:torivaz@protonmail.com).
