# Panels

I love to visit my local community Anime and Video Game conventions in the Pacific Northwest to talk about Japanese culture! Here are some of the panels I have hosted in the past.

I do draw a webcomic, called "THE OMEN CHRONICLES". You can check it out here!

# Zines

I occasionally do illustration, and I'm proud to have an illustration in the Faces of Evil zine, Volume 5: Reptiles.
